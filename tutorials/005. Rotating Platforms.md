Rotating Platforms
------------------
Rotating platform is a special case. Basically we have to extend our KinematicObject class to support manually setting angular velocity:

    void moveToPosition(Vector3f pos, double dt)
    {
        rbody.linearVelocity = (pos - rbody.position) / dt;
        rbody.position += rbody.linearVelocity * dt;

        rbody.orientation += 0.5f * Quaternionf(rbody.angularVelocity, 0.0f) * rbody.orientation * dt;
        rbody.orientation.normalize();

        rbody.updateShapeComponents();
    }

Now we need the character to gain total relative velocity from `floorBody`, the body that he is standing on. This is a sum of linear velocity and a cross product of angular velocity and radius vector pointing from `floorBody` position to character body position. We do everything in `update` method of the `Character` class:

    if (onGround && floorBody && speed == 0.0f && jumpSpeed == 0.0f)
    {
        Vector3f relPos = rbody.position - floorBody.position;
        Vector3f rotVel = cross(floorBody.angularVelocity, relPos);
        rbody.linearVelocity = floorBody.linearVelocity;
        if (!floorBody.dynamic)
        {
            rbody.linearVelocity += rotVel;
        }
    }
    
As you can see, we apply rotation component only if standing on a platform (static body acting as kinematic). Removing this check will result in unstable movement on dynamic bodies.

You might also want to rotate the visual representation of your character according to the rotation of the platform. This is not an easy task and it heavily depends on how rotation are handled in your graphics engine. If, for example, you have a first person camera that is controlled with two rotation parameters, `turn` and `pitch`, things can be as easy as getting negative Y component of platform's angular velocity:

    if (onGround && floorBody && speed == 0.0f && jumpSpeed == 0.0f)
    {
        // ...
        
        turnFactor = -floorBody.angularVelocity.y;
    }
    
This, however, will only work with rotation about Y axis.
