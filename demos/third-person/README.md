Third person game demo
======================
Demonstrates how dmech can be used to implement character kinematics in a fully physics-driven world with dynamic objects and static level geometry.
Uses DGL (http://github.com/gecko0307/dgl) as a graphics engine.

Warning: the code is not up-to-date with current dmech master branch, use with care.
