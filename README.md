dmech
=====
Real-time 3D physics engine written in D language. Currently in early stage of development, hence not considered for production use.

Features
--------
Already implemented:
* Rigid body dynamics with iterative SI solver
* Basic geometry shapes (sphere, box, cylinder, cone, ellipsoid, triangle)
* Support for any convex shapes defined with their support mapping
* Arbitrary static trimeshes (optimization via BVH)
* Ball-socket and slider constraints

Planned in future:
* More shapes (capsule, plane, convex hull, etc.)
* Combined constraint types
* Kinematic bodies
* Vehicle physics
* Particles
