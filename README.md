dmech
=====
Real-time 3D physics engine written in D language. Written with a heavy bias to games - results are not accurate enough to be suitable for scientific simulations. Currently dmech is in early stages of development, hence not considered for production use.

Features
--------
Already implemented:
* Rigid body dynamics with iterative SI solver
* Basic geometry shapes (sphere, box, cylinder, cone, ellipsoid)
* Support for any convex shapes defined with their support mapping
* Constraints: distance, ball-socket, slider

Planned in future:
* More shapes (capsule, plane, convex hull, etc.)
* Arbitrary static trimehes
* Combined constraint types
* Kinematic bodies
* Vehicle physics
* Particles
